      Swami Vivekananda (1863â€“1902) was an Indian monk, philosopher, and spiritual leader who played a key role in introducing the philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Born as Narendra Nath Datta in Calcutta, he was inspired by his guru, Sri Ramakrishna, and dedicated his life to spreading the teachings of Hinduism and its universal message of harmony and spiritual enlightenment.

His powerful speech, which began with the famous words "Sisters and brothers of America," captured the attention of the audience and established him as a prominent voice for interfaith dialogue and religious tolerance.
